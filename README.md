Gather, curate, and feature stories of people using GitHub as part of their open government innovations.

The site is open source (here's all the code!) and is a tool _for_ and _by_ the community.

Submit [issues](https://github.com/github/government.github.com/issues/new) and [pull requests](https://github.com/github/government.github.com/compare/) for stories, site ideas or copy edits.
